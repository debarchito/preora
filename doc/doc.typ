  abstract: [
     Balancing efficiency, pedestrian safety, and emergency response times remains a significant challenge in urban traffic management. This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach integrating pressure plates, intersection cameras, and non-linear mathematical modeling. Pressure plates provide real-time, granular traffic volume data within intersections, while cameras enhance enforcement effectiveness. Data fusion from these sources, coupled with non-linear modeling, optimizes traffic flow and automates pedestrian crossing phases, leading to reduced wait times. Additionally, emergency services can leverage the system for real-time signal prioritization, ensuring faster response times. This comprehensive approach has the potential to significantly improve urban mobility and safety by addressing the complex interplay between traffic flow, pedestrian needs, emergency response requirements among other factors.

= Introduction

The ever-expanding sprawl of urban environments necessitates a paradigm shift in traffic management strategies. Traditional approaches, primarily focused on optimizing vehicle throughput through reliance on pre-programmed traffic lights, struggle to address the multifaceted challenges posed by contemporary cities. These challenges encompass not only traffic flow efficiency but also critical aspects like pedestrian safety and ensuring prompt emergency response times. This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach that integrates pressure plates, intersection cameras, and non-linear mathematical modeling to create a holistic traffic management system. By prioritizing pedestrian safety and emergency response alongside efficiency, this approach aims to optimize urban mobility in a comprehensive manner. The strategic deployment of these methodologies has the potential to not only improve traffic flow but also make a significant contribution to overall urban livability. This research delves into the details of this integrated approach, exploring its theoretical underpinnings and its potential implications for the future of urban transportation systems.

== Motivation

Existing traffic management systems, heavily reliant on pre-programmed traffic light cycles, face significant challenges in handling the dynamic nature of urban traffic. This inflexibility manifests in several key areas:

- *Traffic Congestion*: Densely packed lanes with limited capacity for outflow can create bottlenecks even during green light phases, essentially transforming the intersection into a semi-traffic situation.

- *Pedestrian Safety*: To compensate for long wait times at pedestrian crossings, individuals may resort to risky behavior like jaywalking, compromising their safety and undermining the overall effectiveness of the traffic system. This is particularly concerning for vulnerable populations like disabled individuals and their companions.

- *Lack of Adaptability*: Current traffic management systems, reliant on pre-programmed schedules, are ill-equipped to adapt to real-time disruptions such as accidents, road closures, or unexpected traffic surges. This inflexibility further hinders the development of critical infrastructure like cycling lanes, which require dynamic traffic flow management.

- *Safety Risks*: The limitations of pre-programmed systems extend beyond inefficiency. Lack of real-time monitoring can lead to malfunctions or outdated signal timing, potentially causing safety hazards like false positives (unnecessary stops) or delays during emergencies.

- *Limitations in Adverse Weather*: Pre-programmed traffic management systems struggle to adapt to real-time weather changes. Their inability to dynamically adjust signal timings and lane configurations during events like heavy rain hinders the implementation of safety measures. This inflexibility can compromise both safety and efficiency by preventing adjustments like extended pedestrian crossing phases or reduced speed limits in hazardous conditions, etc.
